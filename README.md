# Hybridized-AES-DES-EncryptionDecryption
The rapid growth of information exchange in recent times through the means of digital communication has led to major developments. This includes exchange of files, audio, classified information, images, videos and many more. Due to its heavy application in fields such as military and corporate workplaces, intruders try to intercept the communication through illegal means and gain access to the classified information. This can result in heavy losses if the leaked data is misused. Hence, an encryption system is required to encrypt and decrypt the data while being communicated so that it can be used by the intended parties only. Existing algorithms are purely symmetric and less dynamic, making it very insecure in todayâ€™s existing technology. This research proposes a hybridized algorithm incorporates features of Data Encryption Standard (DES) into Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) allowing it to be more dynamic and asymmetric.
